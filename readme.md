# Lazy Ray

A ray tracer (well more of a path tracer) that isn't all that effiecent or great in any particular
way. I'm just using it as a learning project with the goals of:
- Becoming more familar with modern c++
- Brushing up on linear algebra
- Learning about computer graphics, in particular ray tracing techniques (duh)
- Maybe dabble with fancy speed stuff like SIMD instructions, writing cache friendly code,
  and parallelism
